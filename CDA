## WHAT: The current NHS Cancer elective service stipulates that patients should not wait for more than 18 weeks to see a specialist.  

# HOW: Here, CCG level data will aid in analysing years 2015 & 2016 trends against the targets using the 
# data of the NHS cancer patients waiting more than one 18 weeks between diagnosis and treatment
